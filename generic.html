							<h2>Olive</h2>
							<p>Olive is an open source project designed with nonprofits in mind. It essentially works as a template application and can be used by any nonprofit that tracks clients and client intake.</p>
							<p>The only downside is that each business needs to deploy their own version of it on the web. I do, however, cover how to do this in the documentation.</p>

							<h2>Cricket's Adventure</h2>
							<p>Cricket's adventure was one of my first big projects. I did it as a collaborative project where I had one other person do all the art, and I coded everything in Pygame. It's a 2-D Platformer where you play as a cat trying to get into a box while projectiles are flying at you.</p>
							<p>The art style was never optimized but it runs great after testing on a few different computers.</p>
